Description

Learn modern, powerful techniques to inspect and analyze network traffic, so you can quickly detect abuse and attacks and respond to them. This class covers the configuration and use of Splunk, the industry standard for network security monitoring. This class helps to prepare for Splunk Core Certified User certification.
Advisory: CNIT 106 and 120, or comparable understanding of networking and security concepts. 

Course Justification
Firewalls and antivirus are not enough to protect modern computer networks--abuse and attacks are common and cannot be prevented. Instead, networks are now monitored to detect security incidents, and security teams respond to them to limit the harm they cause. This class prepares students for jobs in monitoring and incident response, providing skills that are in high demand. This course is part of the Advanced Cybersecurity Certificate.
